      Welcome to The Path to Wellness! <br>
      I have been a Certified Hypnotherapist since 2003, specializing in regression therapy.
      Your circumstances, whether wanted or unwanted, are simply a projection of your inner world, which is a product of your
      belief system.
      Hypnotherapy is a healing modality that assists you in accessing your core beliefs within your subconscious mind and
      releasing the ones that no longer serve you.
      I look forward to assisting you along your journey to wholeness and the life you have always dreamed of!<br>

      <ul>
        <li>Regression Therapy<br>
      Assists you in accessing & resolving the root cause of your unconscious limitations that you experience in your life.
      Such as mind-body ailments, career challenges, relationship problems & financial issues, to name a few. By accessing
      your core beliefs in the subconscious mind through regression therapy, you are able to shift these beliefs to a more
      empowering foundation for your life.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>Past Life Regression<br>
      A method using hypnosis techniques to recover memories of past lives and incarnations. Recalling these memories and
      resolving unfinished issues relating to a particular past life experience, enables you to thoroughly self-heal in this
      life.
      </li>
      <br>
      <br>
      <li>
      Balancing the Masculine & Feminine Energy Bodies<br>
      We all have a Masculine & a Feminine energy body. When these energy bodies are imbalanced, it creates the same imbalance
      in our daily lives. Typically one is always more dominant than the other.
      Our MIND embraces the Masculine Energy & our Feminine Energy embraces the HEART. Masculine is ACTION & Feminine is
      RECEIVING.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
      It is the feminine aspect of yourself that is the CREATIVE ENERGY, it INSPIRES & it DESIRES. It NURTURES & it SUPPORTS.
      But it is the masculine aspect that is necessary to PROTECT the feminine energy & to MANIFEST through ACTION her
      desires. It is our INTELLECTUAL LOGICS, our CONFIDENCE & LOYALTY, our LEADERSHIP aspects.
      Only when these two aspects, that reside within our energy field, are balanced, can we be whole & reach our full
      potential of harmony within.
      </li>
      <br>
      
      <li>Quantum Healing<br>
      A powerful tool used to access that “all knowing” part of ourselves that has been called the Higher Self. This is the
      part of our consciousness that is lower than the soul’s vibration but higher than the physical body. It is the highest
      connection to self-awareness that can be obtained & held in the physical body. That part of you that knows, sees &
      understands at the highest possible level.
      The Higher Self is designed to lead & to guide you. It’s able to access your soul’s information so that you better
      understand the pathway to inner growth & development.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>Tapping (EFT)<br>
      This is a powerful holistic technique effective in resolving issues of emotional distress & physical pain.
      Tapping the body creates a balance in your energetic system based on the belief that a disruption in energy is the cause
      of all negative emotions & pain.
      Tapping focuses on the meridian points to restore balance to your body’s energy. It’s believed that restoring this
      energy balance can relieve symptoms that negative experiences or emotions may have caused.
